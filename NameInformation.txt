Naming conventions:

File Names Are Capitalized

cms.dev
folders: app, assets, lib

If a class is inside these folders but not within a subfolder
	then the name is merely capitalized: Apptest.php

subfolders
lib subfolders: Controller, Model, View

These classes must be named after the folder they are within 
	and the class they contain
	Controller_Index.php

initializing the class within a file:

$controller = new Index();
